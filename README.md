## Code improvements

* Use a linting plugin like eslint, that helps to find and fix problems within JavaScript code. This helps a lot to have a much cleaner browser console.
* Use a code formatting plugin like prettier to help maintain consistency in written code.
* Use TypeScript for a better view of the data flow and avoid parameter transfer errors.
* Use Redux to manage the app's state in a single place and keep changes more predictable and traceable, making it easier to understand the changes happening.
* Using HTML tags correctly (add alt properties in <img>, don't use <a> when not necessary and also use in appropriate cases)
* Validate data coming from the backend before displaying it. (in some cases the error received is displayed as plain text)
* Use of === in place of == for better validation
